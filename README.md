## install
If you have bower installed then you can install it with the following command:

    bower install pathfinding

By default bower will install pathfinding under the bower_components folder, so to include it in your page do something like:
```js
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/bower_components/pathfinding/pathfinding-browser.min.js"></script>
```
You can also grab a release from the Releases Page if you don't use bower.

    npm install --save @types/pathfinding
